# Building a Typechecker from scratch

This is a repository for the [Building a Typechecker from scratch](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/courses/typechecker/) course.

As we want our students to understand and implement every piece of detail from the Typechecker themselves, instead of copy-pasting from the final solution, the source code here provides only an overall structure of the project, leaving the missing parts as assignments. The _"Implement here..."_ comments with references to appropriate video lectures, show specific places which are needed to be completed in order to finalize the full working interpreter.

Example:

```js
if (exp[0] === "def") {
  /* Implement here: */
}
```
